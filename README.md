1. Create a database to implement this image

Note:

 First of all, select dataTypes for corresponding columns. Pay attention:

o COUNTRIES table – Primary key is varchar, not number.

o Employees.Email must be unique


 Secondly, figure out the sequence of tables and data creation.

o For instance: a records in EMPLOYEES cannot be created before a records in DEPARTMENTS, record in JOB HISTORY cannot be created before the EMPLOYEE record


 In EMPLOYEES table employee has a manager – relation is maintained using the EMPLOYEE_ID


 In DEPARTMENTS table MANAGER_ID references an employee by EMPLOYEE_ID



2. Insert manually two records into EMPLOYEES table. Remember: in order to do it you need to prepare the rest of tables. After you do it, you can add seed extra data using this script


3. Write queries to return a corresponding data:

a. Get information about all Employees

b. Get all employees with a name ‘David’

c. Get all employees with job_id equals to ‘IT_PROG’
